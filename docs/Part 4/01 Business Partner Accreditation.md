    To receive Level 3 accreditation, IBMers and Business Partners must demonstrate mastery of the skills learned throughout the various modules of these hands-on labs and coursework. Level 3 accreditation requirements— and the way participants will be evaluated before receiving accreditation —differs depending on job role.

#
# Business Partners must pass an accreditation quiz after completing the hands-on portion of the course.
The quiz consists of multiple choice questions, with four possible responses (and only one correct answer) for each question.The quiz questions will ask you about on-screen text or descriptions that will come up as you work through the lab guide. You will be prompted in the lab guide instructions to RECORD this information, so that you can complete the accreditation quiz questions without needing to redo the lab.
