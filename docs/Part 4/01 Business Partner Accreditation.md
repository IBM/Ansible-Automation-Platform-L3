!!! warning
    To receive Level 3 accreditation, IBMers and Business Partners must demonstrate mastery of the skills learned throughout the various modules of these hands-on labs and coursework. Level 3 accreditation requirements— and the way participants will be evaluated before receiving accreditation —differs depending on job role.

#
# Business Partners must pass an accreditation quiz after completing the hands-on portion of the course.
The quiz consists of multiple choice questions, with four possible responses (and only one correct answer) for each question.The quiz questions are based on elements of the WebSphere Application Server (WAS) web dashboard, which you will be asked to investigate and record specific details about. The WAS environment and dashboard will be available to you after you have successfully concluded the lab work — remaining online until your ITZ reservation has expired.
!!! tip "Expiring environments"
    Note that the ITZ environment can only be reserved for 4 hours at a time. After this period, the instance will automatically be retired and deprovisioned. It is strongly recommended that you complete your investigations for the quiz questions (below) _before_ that time has expired. If not, you will need to run through the lab work another time to bring the WAS environment back online. Record your answers *now* so that you can quickly answer the accreditation quiz questions *later*.
