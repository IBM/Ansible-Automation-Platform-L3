#IBM Sellers and Technical Sellers must develop and record a **Stand & Deliver** presentation.
This video is intended to simulate your delivery of a “live” demo in front of a client — on camera. IBMers will have flexibility in defining a hypothetical client, the pain points that customer has, and the goals they aspire to.The recording will then cover the seller’s hands-on demonstration and pitch to the client of the value of the IBM solution using the environments and techniques covered through this lab.

IBMers will be evaluated by First Line Manager (FLM). Instructions on how to submit a Stand & Deliver via Allego are included on the **YourLearning coursework page**.

The evaluation criteria that your FLM will weigh your performance against are as follows:

1. Seller articulated client's **pain point**(s) and the **value proposition** of using Ansible Automation Platform.

2. Seller highlighted **use cases** for Ansible Automation Platform.

3. Seller demonstrated and discussed several of the key **differentiated capabilities** of Ansible Automation Platform that deliver on thevalue proposition on point one.

4. Seller highlighted **benefits to the client** (this is the *why the client can’t live without these benefits* section).

5. Seller highlighted **benefits to the client's customers** (what will the client be able to deliver to their customers thatthey could not without this product).

6. Seller closed the demo with a **call to action** for the client that could include: a workshop, a deeper dive into theproduct meeting, MVP engagements, and so on.

!!! note "KEYS TO SUCCESS"
    Be sure to incorporate each of these themes and topics into your Stand & Deliver recording, touching on each of them as you run through an end-to-end delivery of the full lab. Good luck!
